DYNAMIC MODEL:
- TODO: Find new cuts to add

IMAI MODEL:
- TODO: Test tighter bounds usefulness
- TODO: Test if tighter bounds is better on variables timestamps or on sum of all actions selected (the second one can be used on Rankooh too)
- FIXME: Why with heuristic an instance generates a wrong optimal????

HEURISTIC:
- TODO: Improve heuristic
- TODO: Try relaxing the model and find a way to reconstruct a feasible plan as an heuristic

EFFICIENCY / MEMORY LEAKS:
- TODO: Make it scale better with size of instance
- FIXME: Better handling of time limit exiting
