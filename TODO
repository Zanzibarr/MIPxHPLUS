DYNAMIC MODEL:
- TODO: Add cycle cuts to the model
- TODO: Find new constraints to add

IMAI MODEL:
- TODO: Test tighter bounds usefulness

ALL MODELS:
- TODO: Fix inverse actions constraint

HEURISTIC:
- TODO: Improve heuristic
- TODO: Try relaxing the model and find a way to reconstruct a feasible plan as an heuristic

EFFICIENCY / MEMORY LEAKS:

- TODO: Better handling of time limit exiting
